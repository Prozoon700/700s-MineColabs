## :hear_no_evil:  First of all, what is google Colab?
As the official FAQ says, colaboratory, or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education. More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing free access to computing resources including GPUs.
In short, it is a vm provided for learning, running python code, machine learning or for general purpose.
## :moneybag:  Is it really free to use?
Yes, Colab is free to use. But there are some points which, according to me one should keep in mind:
1. Though colab is a free service, it shouldn't be exploited indiscriminately or without any care. One should value that its a resource offered for no cost and can get depleted/restricted if the demand increases out of control.
2. If it isn't obvious, one shouldn't run mission-critical services (like large and important servers/databases/python programs) on it. Its resources are not guaranteed and not unlimited, and the usage limits sometimes fluctuate. Also, the notebook has a maximum runtime of 12 hours, after which, it should be manually restarted.
3. If you need to use it pretty often for intensive tasks, consider purchasing a vps server. A heavy increase in server load would force google to close the service.

In the end, it is just my personal opinion and can be ignored safely. Just ask your heart whats right and whats wrong. Also, please try to use it as a once in a while resource and not 24x7 so that others can avail the free resources too.

 - **Performance improvement:** After a long time of development and searching, I have optimized the server with Java Flags, improving performance considerably.
   - *What does it mean?* Now the server works better, it usually does not have lag or delay in response (Playing with Paper).

 - **Creation of a UI:** I have created a "User Interface" so that the creation and in general all the steps are simpler and more visual for the creators.
   - *What does it mean?* Now instead of modifying code, you will simply add values ​​to some fields that are seen visually.

 - **Expanded customization:** You can now customize secondary things like folder names and regions.
